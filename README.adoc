This book is a hands-on guide to dozens of specific ways you can use to get the most of WebDriver in your test automation development. This practical handbook gives you instantly-useful solutions for important areas like interacting with and testing web applications and using the WebDriver APIs. As you read, you'll graduate from WebDriver fundamentals to must-have practices ranging from how to interact with, control and verify web pages and exception handling, to more complex interactions like page objects, alerts, and JavaScript, as well as, mobile testing, and much more. Finally, you'll learn how to build your own framework. By the end of the book, you’ll be confident and skilled at testing your web applications with WebDriver.

== About the technology

Web applications are difficult to test because so much depends on the way a user interacts with individual pages. The Selenium WebDriver web testing framework helps you build reliable and maintainable test automation for your web applications across multiple browsers, operating systems and programming languages. Much like a human, it can click on links, fill out forms, and read the web pages, and unlike a human, it does not get bored. WebDriver can do nearly anything you ask it to—the trick is to come up with a unified approach to testing. Fortunately, that’s where this book really shines.

An essential book for anyone interested in doing WebDriver integration testing. You should have some familiarity with Java development (including basic use of Maven). It starts with basic Selenium WebDriver usage but there’s plenty more. It’s clear that the authors have been using this technology in a professional setting for quite some time as the book is littered with one technique after another which can be used to address problems one can expect when testing real world web applications.

== About the reader

This book assumes you’re comfortable reading code in Java or a similar language and that you know the basics of building and testing applications. No WebDriver experience is required.
