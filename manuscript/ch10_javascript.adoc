= Chapter 10: Executing JavaScript using the `JavascriptExecutor` interface

:imagesdir: ../images/ch10_javascript

This chapter covers

* How to use the `JavascriptExecutor` interface
* Using JavaScript to get information about a web page
* Overriding built-in JavaScript to help make pages easier to test

WebDriver provides a fantastic way to access and interact with web pages in your tests. However, it can't quite do everything. Some browsers do not yet provide a complete implementation of the WebDriver API. Sometimes the WebDriver API does not provide a way to get the information that you need to test a page. In these special cases, you need to bring out the biggest gun -- JavaScript.

This chapter assumes you are already comfortable with JavaScript. If you want to learn the basics of JavaScript, or you're a bit rusty, then you might wish to brush up now. There are many great resources on the Internet; for example, Codecademy provides an online tutorial.footnote:[https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript]

In this chapter, you'll see how you can use WebDriver to execute JavaScript within a browser to find out information about a page that is otherwise inaccessible using WebDriver directly. We'll cover geolocation and web notifications. You'll also learn how to override predefined JavaScript APIs, such as the Geolocation API, so you can control the behavior of the page in ways that WebDriver does not allow you to.

By the end of this chapter you'll know powerful uses of JavaScript with WebDriver that will help you test some of the tougher web pages, and be comfortable with using these techniques in your own code.

== Introduction to executing JavaScript

The `JavascriptExecutor` interface allows you to invoke methods that execute JavaScript. It provides two methods: `executeScript`, which returns as soon as the script is complete, and `executeAsyncScript`, which returns once a callback function is executed (we'll talk about this shortly).

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.java[JavascriptExecutor.java]
----
public interface JavascriptExecutor {

  Object executeScript(String script, Object... args);

  Object executeAsyncScript(String script, Object... args);
}
----

All the main web drivers implement this interface. To use it, you will need to cast the driver to `JavascriptExecutor`.

Typically you cast the driver to expose the `executeScript` and `executeAsyncScript` methods, and then cast the result into the class you expect:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/usage/JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java[JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java]
----
JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver; <1>
long windowWidth = (long) jsExecutor <2>
        .executeScript("return window.innerWidth"); <3>
----
<1> Cast the driver to `JavascriptExecutor`
<2> Cast the result to `long`
<3> Use `return` to get the value in your test

You can pass arguments to your script for execution. Those arguments are made available as the a JavaScript array named `arguments`. The example in listing <<console-log>> will print "Hello JavaScript!" to the JavaScript console.

[[console-log]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/usage/JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java[JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java]
----
JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver; // <1>
jsExecutor.executeScript(
        "var text = arguments[0];" + //<2>
                "console.log(text)",
        "A string to log" //<3>
);
----
<1> Cast the driver.
<2> You can get access to the arguments passed by your test using `arguments`
<3> You pass arguments as the remaining parameters

If you want to execute methods on a `WebElement` you have already found on the page you are testing, then you can also pass that as an argument:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/usage/JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java[JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java]
----
WebElement link = driver.findElement(By.tagName("a"));

JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
jsExecutor.executeScript("var link = arguments[0]; " +
        "link.click()", link);
----

If your are executing a piece of JavaScript that is asynchronous, such as making an a HTTP request using the `XMLHttpRequest` JavaScript class AND you want to wait for the result, you can use the `executeAsyncScript` method.

On top of the existing arguments you pass, the `arguments` variable will have extra variable appended. This variable is a JavaScript function. When you invoke `executeAsyncScript` it will wait for this function to be invoked.

As WebDriver normally expects all scripts to complete immediately, you need to set the timeout to allow enough time for your script to complete using `driver.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout`.

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/usage/JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java[JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java]
----
@Test
public void waitForAsyncJavaScript() throws Exception {

    driver.manage().timeouts()
            .setScriptTimeout(200, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); // <1>

    JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver; // <2>

    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    jsExecutor.executeAsyncScript(
            "var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1];" + // <3>
                    "setTimeout(callback, 100);"); //<4>

    assertThat(System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime, greaterThanOrEqualTo(100L)); // <5>
}
----
<1> Set the timeout to be longer than 100ms.
<2> Cast the driver.
<3> To make it easier to user, extract the callback to a variable name `callback`.
<4> Invoke an asynchronous action (call the `callback` function after 100ms), which will in turn invoke the callback.
<5> Check that at least 100ms has passed.

If you want to return values when executing the script, then pass them as the first argument to the callback function.

[[async-return]]
[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/usage/JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java[JavascriptExecutorUsageIT.java]
----
String result = (String) jsExecutor.executeAsyncScript(
        "var callback = arguments[arguments.length - 1];" + // <1>
                "setTimeout(function() {callback('Hello WebDriver!');}, 100);"); // <2>

assertEquals("Hello WebDriver!", result);
----
<1> Invoke an asynchronous action, which will in turn invoke the callback. This time we pass "Hello WebDriver!" as the argument.

.Tips
****
Here are some quick tips to make working with the methods of `JavascriptExecutor` smoother:

1. If you have a long piece of JavaScript, split it over multiple lines to make it easier to read.
2. Create variables for each argument. This make it easier to understand what they are for.
3. In listing <<async-return>> you can see that the callback is within a function of the form `function() {callback(returnValue);}`. You would typically expect to see this, so if you're having problems, check if it missing.
****

We've had a look at the basic usage of `JavascriptExecutor`. Next, we'll look at some examples of solving problems using it.

== Using JavaScript to examine a page

As the `JavascriptExecutor` has access to every element on a page, you can use it to access information that might be hard to get using normal WebDriver methods. In the next technique, we'll use it to determine if an image has been loaded.

=== Using JavaScript to verify that an image is loaded

You may have a page that does not load correctly, as an image is missing. This technique shows you how to use JavaScript to verify that an image is loaded.



You want to make sure that an image is correctly loaded into a page.



Cast your driver to `JavascriptExecutor` to find out if the image has loaded. A loaded image will fulfill three criteria:

1. It is marked as "complete."
2. It has a natural width, the width of the original image.
3. Its natural width is greater than zero.

These criteria give us a short JavaScript expression:

[source,javascript]
----
    image.complete && typeof image.naturalWidth != 'undefined' <1>
        && image.naturalWidth > 0
----
<1> The `typeof` operator can be used to determine what type a value is

Suppose you have the page shown in figure <<images.png>>.

[[images.png]]
image::images.png[title="Images, one having failed to load - http://localhost:8080/images.html"]

You can write the following test for this page:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/images/VerifyingImagesIT.java[VerifyingImagesIT.java]
----
@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {
    driver.get("/images.html");
}

@Test
public void checkTheImagesAreLoaded() throws Exception {
    assertTrue(isImageLoaded(driver.findElement(By.id("ok"))));
    assertFalse(isImageLoaded(driver.findElement(By.id("broken"))));
}

private boolean isImageLoaded(WebElement image) {
    JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
    return (boolean) jsExecutor.executeScript("return arguments[0].complete && " + <1>
            "typeof arguments[0].naturalWidth != 'undefined' && " +
            "arguments[0].naturalWidth > 0", image);
}
----
<1> Use the JavaScript from the preceding code snippet; note that we cast to `boolean` here



Checking elements may require access to some more unusual attributes. You can find a complete list of HTML attributes on the Mozilla Developer Network: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes.

The example just shown uses JavaScript to examine the attributes. This technique can also be useful for scrolling an element into view, something you cannot do with the `WebDriver` class directly:

[source,java]
----
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("theElement"));
((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(
    "arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);",
    element
);
----

Accessing information that WebDriver does not allow you to directly is one use of `JavascriptExecutor`. Another use is to override built-in JavaScript APIs to make pages easier to test. We'll look at that in the next section.

== Overriding built-in JavaScript APIs

There are a number of JavaScript APIs that are used by web pages to provide richer content. A web page can, for example, ask for the user's geographical location. However, WebDriver does not provide a way to tell the browser what location it should report, or if it should refuse to provide it. As this functionality is implemented as a JavaScript API, you can replace that API with your own implementation, which captures results and controls behavior.

Let's look at an example that uses `Date`, in figure <<print-the-time>>.

[[print-the-time]]
image::print-the-time.png[title="Print The Time -- http://localhost:print-the-time.html"]

This page prints the current time when you click a button. We want to make sure it is correctly formatted. The time comes from the clock of the computer the browser is running on. This changes every time you click the button. Let's have a look at the page's HTML source to understand this a bit more:

[source,html]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/main/webapp/print-the-time.html[print-the-time.html]
----
    <p><a href="javascript:printTheTime();void(0);"
        class="btn btn-default">Print The Time</a></p> <1>

    <p id="time"></p> <2>
    <script>
        function printTheTime() { <3>
            var now = new Date();
            document.getElementById("time").innerHTML
                    = now.getHours() + ":" + now.getMinutes() + ":" + now.getSeconds();
        }
    </script>
----
<1> The button that prints the time
<2> A place for that time to be displayed
<3> A JavaScript function to print the time

The current time is found by executing `new Date()`. `Date` is a JavaScript function, and you can override JavaScript functions. If you want the page to show a specific time instead of the time on the computer (for example, 16:23:45), then you can override the `Date` function with a new function that returns a fixed, predictable value:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/time/PrintTheTimeIT.java[PrintTheTimeIT.java]
----
        ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript(
                "var d = new Date(2016, 1, 1, 16, 23, 45);\n" + // <1>
                        "Date = function() {return d;}" // <2>
        );

        driver.findElement(By.linkText("Print The Time")).click();

        assertEquals("16:23:45", driver.findElement(By.id("time")).getText());
----
<1> Create a `Date` object you want to use
<2> Replace the `Date` function with one that returns your specified date/time.

This approach is great if the application uses JavaScript to determine the date. This date is controlled by the  machine running your tests. If the date is determined from the application server's date (e.g. by writing the date as HTML), then you'll need to use another approach. There are a couple of options:

* Option 1 -- Don't test date based pages.
* Option 2 -- Have the clocks on the server and test machine synchronized, and make sure that test use the current date.
* Option 3 -- Have the server modified for testing purposes so that you can tell it what time it currently is (e.g by a request parameter).

Of these three options, the third is more work, but will result in more reliable tests.

== Using JavaScript to test geolocation

Some websites customize their content and behavior based on the user's location. This is known as *geolocation*.

Geolocation is a problem for testing. Like the time or random numbers, location may change based on factors outside of WebDriver's control. For example, your office may be in New York, so you write your tests assuming that you're in the New York time zone, but they fail as soon as they are run on your Continuous Integration (CI) server -- say, Jenkins -- because the CI server is in London and set to UK time. You might also want to write some tests where the user is located accurately, but some tests for when the user has denied access to location information.

We've provided a page for you to experiment with at http://localhost:8080/geolocation.html. Opening this page will typically take you through a series of steps. First, the browser requests the user's permission to use their location (figure <<geolocation-requesting-permission>>).

[[geolocation-requesting-permission]]
image::geolocation-requesting-permission.png[title=Geolocation requesting permission]

You may see a loading message, as in figure <<geolocation-loading>>.

[[geolocation-loading]]
image::geolocation-loading.png[title=Geolocation Loading]

The page might be denied permission (figure <<geolocation-permission-denied>>).

[[geolocation-permission-denied]]
image::geolocation-permission-denied.png[title=Geolocation permission denied Error]

Or it may be granted permission, in which case you'll see the result in figure <<geolocation-show-result>>.

[[geolocation-show-result]]
image::geolocation-show-result.png[title=Geolocation showing result]

The HTML for displaying the location is as follows:

[source,html]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/main/webapp/geolocation.html[geolocation.html]
----
    <p><a class="btn btn-primary" id="locate"
        href="javascript:locate();void(0);">Find Location</a></p> <1>
    <p id="location">...</p> <2>
    <script>
        function locate() {
            if (!navigator.geolocation) { <3>
                $('#location').html('Not supported.')
            } else {
                $('#location').html('Loading...')
                navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
                    var c = position.coords; <4>
                    $('#location').html('You state you are at + ' + c.latitude +
                        ', ' + c.longitude)
                }, function(e) { <5>
                    $('#location').html('Error: ' + e.code + ' '  + e.message)
                });
            }
        }
    </script>
----
<1> A button to click to print the location
<2> A place for the result to appear
<3> If the browser does not support geolocation, display an error
<4> If we can find the position, display it
<5> Otherwise, display the error

=== Overriding JavaScript to control geolocation



You want to test geolocation. The location of the browser where the tests run can change, and therefore tests are unreliable.



Use `JavascriptExecutor` to replace the `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` function with your own function. The following snippet of JavaScript will do this:

[source,javascript]
----
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition
    = function(ok,err){ok({"coords": {"latitude": 0, "longitude": 0}});}
----

Here's how to use this in your code:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/geolocationjs/GeolocationIT.java[GeolocationIT.java]
----
@Test
public void geoLocationInjection() throws Exception {

    JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
    jsExecutor.executeScript(
            String.format(
                    "navigator.geolocation = navigator.geolocation || {};" +
                            "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition = function(ok,err){" +
                            "ok({'coords': {'latitude': %s, 'longitude': %s}});" +
                            "}", <1>
                    51.5106766,
                    -0.1231314
            ));

    driver.findElement(By.id("locate")).click();

    WebElement location = driver.findElement(By.id("location"));

    new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            (WebDriver d) -> !location.getText().equals("Loading...")); <2>

    assertEquals("You state you are at + 51.5106766, -0.1231314", location.getText());
}
----
<1> Replace the geolocation function
<2> Wait for the result; geolocation can take a moment to complete



This solution has one main caveat -- it only works on pages where the JavaScript snippet can be executed before the location is requested. This means that if the page checks the location on startup, this technique will not work. In this case, you'll need to manually test the page.

You can also use this technique to test error scenarios, such as the user denying access to geolocation:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/geolocationjs/GeolocationIT.java[GeolocationIT.java]
----
@Test
public void positionError() throws Exception {

    JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
    jsExecutor.executeScript(
            String.format(
                    "navigator.geolocation = navigator.geolocation || {};" +
                            "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition = function(ok,err){" +
                            "err({'error': {" +
                            "'PERMISSION_DENIED': 1, " +
                            "'POSITION_UNAVAILABLE': 2, " +
                            "'TIMEOUT': 3" +
                            "}, 'code': %d, 'message': '%s'});}",
                    1,
                    "User denied Geolocation"
            ));

    driver.findElement(By.id("locate")).click();

    WebElement location = driver.findElement(By.id("location"));

    new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
            (WebDriver d) -> !location.getText().equals("Loading..."));

    assertEquals("Error: 1 User denied Geolocation", location.getText());
}
----

These examples only implement part of the API. You can find out more about the Geolocation API here: http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/.

Hopefully, this section has shown you how you can use JavaScript to automate tougher page features. In the next section, we are going to look at another advanced web application feature -- web notifications.

== Automating web notifications

Web notifications are notifications that are pushed by the server to the browser. Rather than appearing in the browser, they appear on the user's desktop (figure <<web-notification-firefox>>). These are also known as "toaster pop ups" or "growls." WebDriver does not provide built-in support for these notifications. Instead, you can use the same JavaScript technique you used for geolocation.

[[web-notification-firefox]]
image::web-notification-firefox.png[title=Web notification on Firefox]

=== Overriding JavaScript to capture a notification



You want to verify that a web notification is displayed.



Use the `JavascriptExecutor` interface to replace the `Notification` function with an implementation that captures the result. This can be achieved by the following JavaScript snippet:

[source,javascript]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/webnotification/Notification.java[Notification.java]
----
Notification = function(title, options) { <1>
    var n = this;  <2>
    notificationTitle = title; <3>
    notificationOptions = options;
    setTimeout(function() { <4>
        (n.onshow || function() {}) (); <5>
    }, 50);
}
----
<1> Replace the `Notification` function
<2> Capture a reference to the newly created object (the notification)
<3> Save the title and options for later inspection
<4> Schedule a callback to call the `onshow` method
<5> Call the `onshow` method

You can encapsulate this in an object similar to the `Select` class:

[source,java]
.link:https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/webnotification/Notification.java[Notification.java]
----
public class Notification {

    private final JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor;

    public Notification(JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor) {
        this.javascriptExecutor = javascriptExecutor;
        this.javascriptExecutor.executeScript(
                "Notification = function(title, options) { \n" +
                        "    var n = this; \n" +
                        "    notificationTitle = title; \n" +
                        "    notificationOptions = options;\n" +
                        "    setTimeout(function() { \n" +
                        "        (n.onshow || function() {}) (); \n" +
                        "    }, 50);\n" +
                        "}");
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return (String)javascriptExecutor
            .executeScript("return notificationTitle");
    }
}
----

Now you can reuse `Notification` in as many places as you need:

[source,java]
.https://github.com/selenium-webdriver-book/source/blob/master/src/test/java/swb/ch10javascript/webnotification/WebNotificationIT.java[WebNotificationIT.java]
----
JavascriptExecutor jsExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
Notification notification = new Notification(jsExecutor);

driver.findElement(By.linkText("Show A Web Notification")).click();

assertEquals("A Web Notification", notification.getTitle());
----



Again, you are overriding the JavaScript function after the page has loaded. This means that if any notifications appear when it loads, you will not be able to intercept and inspect them.

This is an incomplete solution. There are also other functions, such as `onclose`, that you may want to implement. For more information about this API, see the W3C website: http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/.

== Summary

* The `JavascriptExecutor` interface can be used to examine elements within the page that are hard to access with WebDriver directly.
* You can override built-in JavaScript APIs to control certain web page features. This can apply to times and dates, geolocation, and web notifications.
* There's no such thing as a free lunch! If these APIs are used as soon as the page loads, you will not have time to replace them before they are first used.

In the next chapter we will look at the variety of different browsers that WebDriver supports, and how to configure them.
